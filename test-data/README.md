# Test Data Files

These are simple test files you can use to test the processors without needing real export files.

## Files Included

- `test_twitter.json` - Sample Twitter/X export with a few tweets and a thread
- `test_facebook.html` - Sample Facebook Messenger HTML export

## How to Use

1. Open PastPatch at http://localhost:3000
2. Select a tool (e.g., "Twitter/X Thread Builder")
3. Upload the corresponding test file
4. Watch it process and download the result!

## Creating More Test Data

### For Snapchat/Instagram
You would need actual export ZIP files from those platforms, as they contain complex JSON structures and media files.

### For TikTok
Upload any MP4 video file to test basic functionality.

### For WhatsApp
You would need an actual .db backup file from WhatsApp.

## Note

These test files are simplified versions. Real export files from the platforms will have more complex structures, but these should help you verify the basic functionality works!
